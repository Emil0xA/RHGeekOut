Saturday GEEK-OUT!
==================
#### Computing Society, Royal Holloway, University of London
Royal Holloway, Computing Society's Saturday GEEK-OUT! is a casual hands-out event for members to meet like-minded people. There are theme of the day which participants can follow, or they can set their own goal for the day as well (e.g. learning a new programming language, writing a new piece of code, contributing to the open source community, etc.). 

This repository contains codes I've written for some of these sessions.

##### Audio-Visual Programming (15th November 2014)
The aim of this session is to create sound/noise from image files. I created a simple Java program that reads RGB values of image files and store them in a 2D array. These values can then be used to create sound/noise however you want (you'll have to code it yourself). 

I did mine by dividing R/G/B and store them as a row vector, and have MATLAB play it. You can find a picture of Bletchley Park, and its corresponding sound wave in my repo. It's really just noise rather than sound.
